# simplebox.js

simplebox.js is a lightweight lightbox plugin (1.4 KB) that is easy to modify or extend to fit your needs. This plugin is intended to be a quick, responsive, efficient.

The idea behind this plugin was to make setting up lightbox painless. My experience with finding and setting up lightbox plugins has been pretty bad. The plugins I've come across almost always have too many features. simplebox.js is designed to have just one feature: lightboxing. It's responsive out of the box and allows only a few crucial settings. Think of the minimalism as feature and not a drawback!

## Usage

- To get started, clone or download the zip for the repository
- Once downloaded, you can checkout the demo inside the demo folder
- To hook the plugin up with your website, copy everything in the /dist folder and add it your project.
    1. You can either include the simplebox.min.css as a an individual file to your project but I would recommend including it into your main stylesheet (as an SCSS partial?) to cut down on HTTP requests.
